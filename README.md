Libft
=====

Introduction:
  Libft is a 1337/42 school project that aims to recode the standred C library functions.
----------------------
What did I learned:

  during the work on this project I got to dive deep to how the standred C library functions work, also It was a realy good way for me to learn the basics   of C programming language.

-------------
How to use:
- use 'Make' to create the project
- use 'Make clean' to remove objects
- use 'Make fclean' to remove objects and binary
- use 'Make re' to recreate the project
